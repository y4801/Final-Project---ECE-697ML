### LRO Dataset

The following images were taken from Lunar Orbiters I-V, sourced from the [Lunar Orbiter Photo Gallery Website](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/lunarorbiter/).

The number that begins each image indicates the Lunar Orbiter Mission Number for the image. For example: 1005.jpg was taken from Lunar Orbiter I.

The classifications for each image were provided by the creators of this project and labeled to the best of their ability. They can be found in this directory (LRO-dataset) in the file "LRO-classes.xlsx". The folder "sample_classes" was used as a template from the HiRISE dataset to help classify images according to its classes.

The classes are numbered based on the following labels:

0	other
1	crater
2	dark dune
3	slope streak
4	bright dune
5	impact ejecta
6	swiss cheese
7	spider
